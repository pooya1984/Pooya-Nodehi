#PROJECT
I have actively contributed to a wide range of projects that span UI/UX design, front-end development, and graphic design. My experience includes collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to create user-centered digital experiences across various platforms.
In UI/UX Design, I have been involved in the entire design process, from initial research and wireframing to prototyping and usability testing. I focus on creating intuitive interfaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functionally effective, ensuring seamless user journeys.
As a Front-End Developer, I have translated design concepts into responsive, interactive web applications using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React. I work closely with both design and backend teams to ensure that the user interface is both technically robust and visually aligned with the project goals.
Additionally, I have extensive experience in Graphic Design, where I create visually compelling designs for branding, digital marketing, and print media. My expertise includes working with Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, XD) to deliver high-quality visuals that communicate a brand's identity and message effectively.
Throughout my career, I have been involved in various projects, each allowing me to refine my skills and contribute to successful, impactful digital products.
